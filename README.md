# zsync

This is a fork of zsync 0.6.2 (http://zsync.moria.org.uk/) with bugfixes and support for libcurl.
This project is essentially abandoned (I haven't worked on it in years) although feel free to
file an issue if you have any questions. I'll answer if I can.

The rationale for the fork was:

- Switch to libcurl instead of hand-rolled http client, mostly for https support
- Fixing a few bugs here and there
